### Hello ðŸ‘‹
My name is Leonardo Di Giusto, I have a degree in Industrial Technologies Engineering specialized in industrial organization, programming, automation and mechatronics.
I am currently studying programming in more depth and of all kinds as it is my ambition.


## Skills
* Knowledge of industrial organization and techniques
* Knowledge in c, c++ and c# programming.
* Aware of continuous improvement and optimization.
* FPGA configuration knowledge (my final thesis was about building a resistive meter with an FPGA using a wheatstone bridge and showing the results on a LCD display).
