### HELLO ðŸ‘‹

My name is Leonardo Di Giusto.
I have a degree in Industrial Technologies Engineering specialized in industrial organization, programming, automation and mechatronics.
I am currently studying programming in more depth and of all kinds as it is my ambition.
I made this Github to upload my Malaga 42 projects and other projects and store some other interesting information.
